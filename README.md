# findatree

Open-source object-based analysis of forest health using drone data. 

## Installation

 
 **NOTE:**: This package was developed and tested on Windows 10 in a conda environment created with conda (version = 4.10.1).
 
To create a [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment with all the necessary dependencies we provide an 
[environment.yml](https://github.com/FlorianStehr/findatree/blob/master/environment.yml). 
This will create a conda environment `findatree` with all the necessary depencies:
 
```console
conda create -f environment.yml
```

Enjoy :)
