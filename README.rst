Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
 **NOTE:**: This package was developed and tested on Windows 10 in a conda environment created with conda (version = 4.10.1).
 
To create a `conda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ environment with all the necessary dependencies we provide an 
`environment.yml <https://github.com/FlorianStehr/findatree/blob/master/environment.yml>`_.
 
 ```sh
 conda create -f environment.yml
 ```
 
 This will create a conda environment 'findatree' with all the necessary depencies.
